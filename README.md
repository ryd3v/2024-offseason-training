# Training Plan

This repository contains the exercises for my 2024 off-season. I created my own personalized workout plan. It's designed
as a simple and efficient plan for bodybuilding.

## The plan is [here](train.md).

## Getting Started

The sets are 12–15 per muscle group, with a rep range of 8–15 reps. 2 warm-up sets should be performed on each muscle
group
trained.

I based my sets and reps on scientific data that suggests a 12-set maximum is sufficient for muscle growth, without the
risk of over training and unneeded fatigue. [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/ei-38EcxHE4?si=T5B3-HjxZuBCVAzl). Use the
advice at your own risk.

### Prerequisites

You need a gym, with access to free weight and machines. I also use a tracker app on my phone to keep track of
sets/reps. I use [mw+](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/my-workout/id789343008)

### Workouts

Inspiration for my plan comes from the training style similar to Jay Cutler, nice video playlist here that shows the
various workout
methods [New Improved and Beyond DVD](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL34s-yGsKuy9Rcswqe0IPiLc70yasd0lW&si=ZvvhbiGE31_yg13D)

### Days

I train every day except Sunday, I take a rest day when needed, but cycle through the program in order. Chest, Back,
Shoulders, Arms, Traps, and Legs. If you need an extra day off, don't sweat it, but don't, not go because you're lazy.
Some of my best workouts have been on days I didn't feel like going.

### Diet

90% is diet, so make sure that's on point.
I'll post my diet later on, basically I'm doing 300g of carbs and 300g of
protein per day, and approximately 120g fats.
This is an Off season Diet.
