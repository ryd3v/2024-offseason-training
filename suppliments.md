# Suppliments

In the morning when I wake up I have 500ml water with one scoop of BCAA's and a scoop of glutamine.

- [Allmax Essentials Glutamine](https://a.co/d/1N2pix2) 1 scoop
- [ALLMAX Nutrition Aminocore BCAA](https://a.co/d/heT6fek)

My first protien shake of the day to break my fast

- [ALLMAX Isoflex Chocolate](https://a.co/d/cmxIHoZ)

I use 2 scoops, with 40g of whole oats and a scoop of almond butter, with 400ml of almond milk, or water.
